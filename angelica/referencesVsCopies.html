    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const cop = players.slice();
    const cop2 = [...players];
    const cop3 = [].concat(players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
cop[3] = "tex";
cop2[2] ="ker";
console.log(players,cop,cop2);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };


    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
const cosa = Object.assign({},person,{age: 12});
console.table(cosa);

const wes = {
  name: 'Wes',
  age: 100,
  social: {
    twitter: '@wesbos',
    facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
  }
};
const cosa2 = Object.assign({},wes);
const cosa3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
